Testing:

We run all the C++ tests available in re2 distribution (see ../src/re2cpp/re2/testing), but using
R interface. We simply replace the C++ implentation to call R functions. We use RInside
package which embeds an R instance inside our C++ tests. This way we let C++ tests
call R functions (in R/RcppExports.R) which mimic the behaviour of corresponding C++ methods in re2.cc.

The C++ -> R interface to re2 is provided by re2_R.[h|cc] files. These files
look very similar to re2.[h|cc] files, except the implemnation of C++ is replaced by
calling R functions directly.

For test builds, a symlink farm of the re2 distribution files will be created
in this folder (see the Makefile). re2.cc is symlinked to re2_R.cc, and same with re2.h.
This way we can reuse the original Makefile (src/re2cpp/Makefile) to compile and run tests.

Make sure RInside is intalled.

To run all re2 C++ tests through R interface:
> make test

You should see the following output:
