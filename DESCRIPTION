Description: Pattern matching, extraction, replacement and other string
  processing operations using Google's RE2 <https://github.com/google/re2>
  regular-expression engine. Consistent interface (similar to 'stringr').
  RE2 uses finite-automata based techniques, and offers a
  fast and safe alternative to backtracking regular-expression engines
  like those used in 'stringr', 'stringi' and other PCRE implementations.
